# Keras GAN for MNIST

Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) implementation using the [Keras](https://keras.io/ "Keras") library.  
Several of the tricks from [ganhacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks) have been implemented.

`mnist_dcgan.py` provides a Deep Convolutional Generative Adverserial Network (DCGAN) implementation.  
Each epoch takes approx. 1 minute on a NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU (using Amazon EC2).

`mnist_gan.py` a standard GAN using fully connected layers.
